## ASki
Our guildroom ASki is is located in <a target='_self' href='https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/60.1873/24.81847'>TUAS building's first floor</a>, at the end of a corridor behind the library. ASki's name ('matchbox') comes from the early days of the guild, when the guildroom was a tiny room in the T-building. In 2003 when TUAS-building was opened, ASki moved in where it currently is. The grand opening was held on the anniversary week November 17th 2003 and nowadays ASki's birthday is celebrated around that date.

ASki is the livingroom of the guild members, where one can spend time between lectures by, for example, playing board- and videogames and reading magazines. There have also been sightings of people actually studying there. ASki has a small kitchen and a kiosk for your snacking needs and serves tea and (FREE) coffee!

The committee of ASki, Guardians of ASki lead by the Master of ASki, is in charge of usage, filling of the cabinets and overall order of ASki. If you have any development ideas or problems involving ASki, the committee is the right place to contact. Contact informations can be found under <a target='_self' href='/en/guild/officials'>Committees page</a>

ASki also contains the guilds storage room, from which the board and the members of the Committee of ASki can sell guild's overall badges, songbook and AS merch.
