### 1 § Election Declaration

The guild’s board delivers to members, either together with the meeting invitation or otherwise, an election declaration which specifies:
- The start time of the candidacy period
- The end time of the candidacy period
- The election forum to be used (hereinafter referred to as the election forum)
- The board’s proposal regarding the method of board selection, which will be confirmed at the election meeting:
   - Either the entire board is elected by direct election, **_or_**
   - A board-former is chosen, whose proposal must enjoy the confidence of the meeting.


### 2 § Registering candidacy

A candidate may be nominated:
- In the election forum specified in the election declaration, while candidacy is open, **_or_**
- After the opening of the election meeting and before the close of candidacy, through the chairperson appointed for the meeting.

The applicant introduces themselves and states which positions they are applying for, either in the election forum or at the election meeting. 
Depending on the forum, questions may be posed to the applicant while candidacy is open.


#### Applying for Multiple Positions

If a candidate applies through the election forum for multiple mutually exclusive 
positions that are selected within the same meeting item, they must clearly indicate 
their priority order for these positions on the election forum.

### 3 § Election Campaigning

A candidate is permitted to engage in election campaigning under the following conditions:
- Campaigning through the guild’s official channels, such as mailing lists and other electronic communities or messaging platforms, is prohibited.
   - Except for invitations to election panels or similar events where all candidates have an equal opportunity to be heard.
- Bribery is strictly prohibited.

### 4 § Meeting Practices

#### Subsection 1. Order of Selection When the Entire Board Is Elected by Direct Election

At the meeting, the guild's board and officials shall be elected in the following order:
1. Chairperson of the board
2. Board members, prioritizing positions with the highest number of first-priority applications first.
    - If the number of applicants is equal, the chairperson of the meeting shall determine the order after consulting the candidates.
3. Chairpersons of committees
4. Other officials
    - The meeting may decide to delegate the selection of officials to the sitting board, which shall make the decision based on the proposals by  committee chairpersons.
    - For positions that are not part of any committee, the board shall decide based on applications.

#### Subsection 2. Order of Selection When Using a Board-former

In the board-former model, the election is carried out in two separate meetings:

1. In the first meeting, a board-former is elected.
2. In the second meeting, the board-former presents their proposed board composition, which requires the meeting’s approval.
    - If the proposal is approved, the board is considered elected, and the board-former becomes the chairperson of the board.
    - If the proposal is rejected, the board-former has the right to make a second proposal.
    - If the second proposal is also rejected, a new board-former is elected, and the process begins again.
3. Committee chairpersons
4. Other officials
    - By decision of the meeting, the election of officials may be left to the sitting board, which decides based on the proposals of the committee chairpersons. 
    - For positions outside committees, the board decides based on the applications.


#### Candidate Introductions

Each candidate shall be given an opportunity to deliver an introductory speech of a 
length determined by the chairperson of the meeting for each position they apply for. 
Following the speech, candidates may be asked questions in a manner determined by the 
chairperson of the meeting.

#### Endorsement Speeches

After the candidates have introduced themselves and answered questions, time shall be 
allocated for endorsement speeches. Unless otherwise decided in advance by the guild’s 
board, candidates shall leave the room during the endorsement speeches. The intention to 
deliver an endorsement speech must be declared to the guild’s board before the meeting 
begins or to the chairperson of the meeting before the candidacy registration period for 
the relevant position closes. The chairperson of the meeting may, at their discretion, 
deny the right to deliver an endorsement speech, provided that no candidate is placed in 
an unequal position.

### 5 § Election Method

Elections shall be conducted using a closed ballot unless the meeting unanimously 
decides otherwise. The recommended voting method is proportional representation, in 
which:
- In elections where a single person is elected, the candidate with the fewest votes is 
eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to the next preferred candidate chosen by
their voters.
- In elections where multiple people are elected, a vote threshold is calculated, and the
candidates who first exceed the threshold are elected.

### 6 § Violation of Electoral Order

If the electoral order is violated, the board has the right to act as it deems 
appropriate. This may include issuing a warning or disqualifying the offending 
individual from the elections. The English translation was done on March 6th 2025 and

### 7 § Amendment
On matters not specified in these rules, the guild’s board decides. These rules may be amended by a two-thirds (2/3) majority vote of the guild meeting.
