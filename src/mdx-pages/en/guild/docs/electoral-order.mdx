### 1 § Election Declaration

The board of the guild shall issue an election declaration to the members together with the meeting invitation or otherwise, specifying:
- The start time of the candidacy registration period
- The end time of the candidacy registration period
- The designated election forum (hereinafter referred to as the election forum)
- The method of electing the board:
   - The entire board elected through a direct election, **or**
   - A board-former, whose proposal must receive the confidence of the meeting

### 2 § Registering candidacy

A candidate must register their candidacy through the election forum specified in the 
election declaration while the candidacy registration period is open or after the 
opening of the election meeting but before the candidacy period is closed by the 
meeting’s elected chairperson. The candidate must introduce themselves and indicate the 
positions they are applying for either on the election forum or at the election meeting. 
Depending on the forum, questions may be posed to the candidate while the candidacy 
registration period is open.

#### Applying for Multiple Positions

If a candidate applies through the election forum for multiple mutually exclusive 
positions that are selected within the same meeting item, they must clearly indicate 
their priority order for these positions on the election forum.

### 3 § Election Campaigning

A candidate is permitted to engage in election campaigning under the following conditions:
- Campaigning through the guild’s official channels, such as mailing lists and other electronic communities or messaging platforms, is prohibited.
   - Except for invitations to election panels or similar events where all candidates have an equal opportunity to be heard.
- Bribery is strictly prohibited.

### 4 § Meeting Practices

#### Order of Selection

At the meeting, the guild's board and officials shall be elected in the following order:
1. Chairperson of the board
2. Board members, prioritizing positions with the highest number of first-priority applications first.
   - If the number of applicants is equal, the chairperson of the meeting shall determine the order after consulting the candidates.
3. Chairpersons of committees
4. Other officials
   - The meeting may decide to delegate the selection of officials to the sitting board, which shall make the decision based on the proposals by  committee chairpersons.
   - For positions that are not part of any committee, the board shall decide based on applications.

#### Candidate Introductions

Each candidate shall be given an opportunity to deliver an introductory speech of a 
length determined by the chairperson of the meeting for each position they apply for. 
Following the speech, candidates may be asked questions in a manner determined by the 
chairperson of the meeting.

#### Endorsement Speeches

After the candidates have introduced themselves and answered questions, time shall be 
allocated for endorsement speeches. Unless otherwise decided in advance by the guild’s 
board, candidates shall leave the room during the endorsement speeches. The intention to 
deliver an endorsement speech must be declared to the guild’s board before the meeting 
begins or to the chairperson of the meeting before the candidacy registration period for 
the relevant position closes. The chairperson of the meeting may, at their discretion, 
deny the right to deliver an endorsement speech, provided that no candidate is placed in 
an unequal position.

### 5 § Election Method

Elections shall be conducted using a closed ballot unless the meeting unanimously 
decides otherwise. The recommended voting method is proportional representation, in 
which:
- In elections where a single person is elected, the candidate with the fewest votes is 
eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to the next preferred candidate chosen by
their voters.
- In elections where multiple people are elected, a vote threshold is calculated, and the
candidates who first exceed the threshold are elected.

### 6 § Violation of Electoral Order

If the electoral order is violated, the board has the right to act as it deems 
appropriate. This may include issuing a warning or disqualifying the offending 
individual from the elections. The English translation was done on March 6th 2025 and
