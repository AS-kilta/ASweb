### 1 § Appearance

The overalls of the Guild of Automation and Systems Technology must be violet with a
black left sleeve, which has a white pocket, and a light blue right thigh pocket. The color
codes used are: Violet: L: 30, a: 21, b: -35 (or the closest possible match) and Light blue:
L: 57, a: -31, b: -12 (or the closest possible match). On the back of the overalls, there
must be the Guild of Automation and Systems Technology logo, with the text
"Automaatio- ja systeemitekniikan kilta" above it and "Aalto-yliopisto" below it. No
advertisements shall be printed on the left chest pocket, the left sleeve pocket, or the
right thigh pocket.

### 2 § Modifications to the Overalls

Any modifications to the above-mentioned features must be approved in a guild
meeting. This includes changes to the color of the overalls or their parts, except for
one-time modifications, such as an individual pocket for a sponsor advertisement.
Sections 1 § and 2 § do not apply to overalls ordered before the adoption of these
regulations, nor to personal modifications of an individual’s own overalls.

### 3 § Use of Overalls

A person wearing the guild’s overalls, or parts of them in another overall, represents the
Guild of Automation and Systems Technology and the entire technology student
community. Therefore, when wearing the overalls, one must conduct themselves in a
manner that does not violate the values of these communities or bring them disgrace.
In cases of gross violations of these guidelines, the guild board may impose a sanction
on the individual at its discretion.

### 4 § Matters Not Defined in These Guidelines

Any matters not defined in these guidelines shall be decided by the guild board.
