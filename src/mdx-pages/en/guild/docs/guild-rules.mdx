## Chapter II – Members and membership fees

### Section 5 Members

The members of the Guild include full members, old members, associate members and honorary members. Any person who is interested in the Guild activities and has a right to study at the Aalto University can be admitted into the Guild as a full member.

A person who has been a full member in the past but does not currently meet the membership criteria for a full member set in these Rules, can be admitted as an old member.

A person who is interested in the activities of the Guild but does not meet the membership criteria for a full or an old member set in these Rules, can be admitted as an associate member.

A person who has distinguished themselves in the Guild activities or otherwise contributed significantly to the purpose of the Guild can be invited to accept honorary membership by three-fourths (3/4) of the votes cast in a Guild meeting.

The Board of the Guild (‘the Board’) puts forward nominations for honorary members. In addition, nominations for honorary memberships can be put forward by at least one tenth (1/10) of all full members of the Guild or at least thirty (30) full members of the Guild. The Guild can have no more than ten (10) honorary members at a time.

### Section 6 Membership register

The Guild must keep a register of all its members. Each member’s full name, address and email address are entered in the register. The members are obligated to notify the Guild of any changes to the above information so that the changes can be entered in the register.

### Section 7 Membership fees

Members are charged a membership fee each academic year. The membership period is from September to August. The annual general meeting of the Guild sets the amounts of the full and associate membership fees. The membership fees may vary between different membership classes. Honorary and old members are not subject to membership fees.

### Section 8 Resignation from the Guild

A member may resign from the Guild by notifying the Board or the Chairperson of the Board of the resignation in writing, or by giving a notice thereof in a Guild meeting for entry in the minutes of the meeting. The resignation enters into force immediately. The personal information of the resigned member is removed from the membership register.

If a member fails to pay the membership fee within a month of the start of the membership period, the member is deemed to have resigned. The member will receive a notice thereof in the email address entered in the membership register. The personal information of the member is removed from the membership register.

### Section 9 Expulsion from the Guild

In addition to the grounds for expulsion provided for in the Finnish Associations Act (503/1989), the Board may also expel

1. a full member whose study right at the Aalto University has ended and who does not, therefore, meet the membership criteria set for a full member
2. a member who has blatantly violated the Guild’s Rules or Code of Conduct. Before the Board takes the decision to expel a member, the member must be reserved the right to prepare a response, unless the ground for expulsion is failure to pay the membership fee.

A written decision must be sent to the expelled member to the email address entered in the membership register without a delay.

The expelled member has the right to appeal the Board’s decision by lodging an appeal in writing to a Guild meeting. The decision to expel a member in a Guild meeting requires the support of at least three-fourths (3/4) of the votes cast.

The expelled member must submit their appeal to the Board within thirty (30) days of being notified of the decision. The appeal must be processed in the following Guild meeting, but no later than within sixty (60) days of its date of submission.

### Section 10 Disciplinary action

If a member has through their behaviour caused harm to the operations of the Guild or acted against the Guild’s Rules or operating principles, the Board may restrict the member’s participation in the Guild activities as a disciplinary action. Participation in the Guild meetings cannot, however, be restricted. The disciplinary model is specified in the Guild’s Code of Conduct.
