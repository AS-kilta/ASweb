### 1 § Purpose

The primary purpose of investments is to maintain the guild’s wealth and support its 
operational activities. The guild’s investment assets are primarily increased through 
the financial year’s profit. The guild’s investments must be managed according to these 
guidelines. Any redirection of investment activities must be done by amending these 
guidelines. The guidelines have been formulated in a way that aims to ensure investment 
activities do not become a burden on the guild’s financial management.

### 2 § Investment Plan

The portfolio should consist of three parts, each representing approximately one-third 
of the portfolio’s market value:
1. A broad index fund (e.g., a fund investing in MSCI World, MSCI USA, or S&P 500 
indices)
2. An ESG index fund or another low-cost fund that invests responsibly
3. A real estate investment fund (REIT)

The funds held on the guild’s investment platform (those to be invested and those 
previously invested) are allocated as follows:
- 10–50% (recommended 33%) is invested in the “Lyxor MSCI World LUX UCITS ETF” (ticker: 
X010) or a similar fund
- 10–50% (recommended 33%) is invested in the “UBS ETF (LU) MSCI World Socially 
Responsible UCITS ETF (USD) A-acc” (ticker: SEAC) or a similar fund
- 10–50% (recommended 33%) is invested in the “SPDR Dow Jones Global Real Estate UCITS 
ETF (Dist)” (ticker: SPYJ) or a similar fund

### 3 § Action

Investment decisions are made at the guild meeting if the outgoing board members have 
been granted discharge from liability for the past financial year. Investments are 
proposed primarily by the guild's board based on the treasurer’s proposal. The 
investment proposal must specify the investment amount and timeline. The board may 
consult an investment officer for advice when preparing the proposal. The investment 
officer does not hold financial responsibility within the guild. If there is no 
investment officer in the guild, the treasurer may assume all responsibilities assigned 
to the investment officer in this document.

Investment assets are accumulated by investing 20–90% of the previous financial year’s 
profit. The guild may use the annual dividend for its projects and initiatives. The 
liquidation of investments requires approval from the guild meeting, except for sales 
carried out as part of portfolio rebalancing.

However, the guild meeting may, for a special reason, decide not to follow these guidel
ines, for example, if making investments is deemed inappropriate. In such cases, the 
guild meeting may decide not to invest the profit or to reduce the amount to be invested.

### 4 § Amendment

Matters not specified in these guidelines are decided by the guild’s board. These 
guidelines can be amended by a two-thirds (2/3) majority vote in the guild meeting.
