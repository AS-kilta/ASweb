# Code of Conduct of the Guild of Automation and Systems Technology
This document contains the Code of Conduct (‘the CoC’), which serves as a guideline for activities of the Guild of Automation and Systems Technology (‘the Guild’). The CoC applies to all persons who are part of the Guild’s community. Anyone who participates in the Guild’s activities is considered to be part of the Guild’s community. This document is divided into three chapters: Chapter 1 defines the Guild’s Code of Conduct, Chapter 2 the role of a confidential counsellor and Chapter 3 the procedure for dealing with violations of the CoC.

## Chapter I – Code of Conduct

### Section 1 Personal identity

Everyone participating in the Guild’s activities has the right to be themselves and to be treated equally regardless of any personal characteristic, such as sex, gender, gender identity, ethnicity, age, language, financial status, or sexual orientation.
For more information regarding this, please see the Guild’s Plan for Equality.

### Section 2 Harassment

The Guild does not allow any racist, sexist, offensive, violent or threatening behaviour, discrimination, or bullying. Anyone observing such behaviour should report it to a confidential counsellor, so that it can be addressed according to the provisions of Chapter 3.

### Section 3 Behaviour and representation

Anyone participating in the Guild’s activities agrees to comply with the Guild’s ethical principles, to respect other people in accordance with principles of equality, to act honestly and ethically, to promote open and free discussion and mutual trust, and to actively work for their own and others’ safety and wellbeing.

If it is discovered that a person is acting in clear violation of the Guild’s ethical principles in or outside of the Guild’s activities, or has a history of doing this, the provisions of Chapter 3 may be enforced.

### Section 4 Guild’s property

The Guild respects the right to property. It is forbidden to damage, dispose of or steal property which is in the Guild’s possession or borrowed by it. All members of the Guild are responsible for looking after the ASki guild room by cleaning up after themselves and taking care of their own and shared property.

### Section 5 Privacy and data protection

The Guild respects the right to privacy and the right to data protection. The processors and users of personal or sensitive data must adhere to data protection requirements regardless of the format, storage method or repository of the data.

### Section 6 Conflicts of interest

In Guild activities, conflicts of interests may arise. Any possible conflicts of interest must be brought up to and dealt with in cooperation with the Guild’s operations inspectors.

### Section 7 Partners

The Guild operates as part of a network of communities and collaboration partners, working only with trusted partners that adhere to ethical guidelines or other principles similar to those of the Guild.

### Section 8 Sustainable development

The Guild is committed to the principles of sustainable development, such as cultural and environmental sustainability, seeking actively to apply them in all its activities, events and guild room activities.

## Chapter II – Confidential counsellor

### Section 9 Election

Confidential counsellors are elected from among the Guild’s members in a manner determined by a Guild meeting. Should no confidential counsellors be elected in the meeting, the Board appoints one or more volunteers as confidential counsellors. If needed, the Board appoints one of its members in the position.

### Section 10 Obligations and responsibilities

A confidential counsellor is the first contact point for those participating in Guild activities for handling possible harassment cases. The counsellor must be prepared to discuss the incident with the parties involved, to take the matter forward, and, so far as possible, support the parties involved in the processing of the incident. The counsellor must participate in the investigation process of the CoC violation.
The position of the confidential counsellor is strictly confidential, meaning that the processed cases cannot be disclosed to any third party unless otherwise specified or required.

### Section 11 Taking the matter forward

After a harassment incident has taken place, a confidential counsellor must take the matter forward, provided that the injured party has given consent for it.
Taking the matter forward may include the following actions:
- Notifying the Board for processing of the CoC violation.
- Notifying the Aalto University or the harassment contact persons of the Aalto University Student Union.
- Referring the injured party to public or healthcare services, as appropriate.

## Chapter III – Procedure in the event of CoC violation

In the event of a violation of the CoC, the Guild applies a 6-step disciplinary model. The nature of the offence in question determines the level at which the matter will be handled. If the offence requires disciplinary action that exceeds level 3, the injured person must be informed of the decision made. If the injured party or the offender is a Board member, the member must recuse themselves from the processing of the case.

List of sections
1. Section 12 Discussion with confidential counsellor or Board member
2. Section 13 Verbal warning
3. Section 14 Written warning
4. Section 15 Dismissal from duties
5. Section 16 Ban from Guild activities

### Section 12 Discussion with confidential counsellor or Board member

A confidential counsellor or a member of the Board discusses with the suspected offender and decides how to proceed in the matter as appropriate.

The confidential counsellor or the Board member may discuss the matter with the Board while making sure that the injured party remains anonymous.

### Section 13 Verbal warning

The Board or a confidential counsellor prepares and issues the offender a personal warning for committing the offence. The confidential counsellor must inform the Board of the issued warning. The purpose is to ensure that the offence will not be repeated.

### Section 14 Written warning

A confidential counsellor, together with the Board, issues the offender a written warning. The warning is filed in a separate archive of the Guild that can only be accessed by the confidential counsellors and the Board.
The warning must state that, if needed, event organisers will be notified of the warning in connection with an organisation of an event.

Warnings are issued for a fixed period, but no longer than for 5 years.

### Section 15 Dismissal from duties

If a person misuses their position or otherwise violates the CoC in Guild activities, the Guild will act in accordance with Section 19 of the Guild’s Rules.

Section 14 will also be enforced.

### Section 16 Ban from Guild activities

The Board, together with a confidential counsellor, may ban an offender from activities organised by the Guild. If the activities are organised in collaboration with another entity, it must be informed that the person in question is not allowed to participate.

Section 14 will also be enforced.
The punishment may be revoked by a unanimous vote of the Board or by three-fourths (3/4) of votes cast in a Guild meeting.

### Section 17 Expulsion

Under Section 8 of the Guild’s Rules, the Board has the right to expel a person who has committed a very serious offence. The person is, however, reserved the right to submit a response.

Section 14 will also be enforced.
