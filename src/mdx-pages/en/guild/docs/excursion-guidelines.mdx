### 1 § Validity of Excursion Rules

These excursion rules apply to all excursions organised by the Guild of Automation and
Systems Technology (hereinafter referred to as the guild) and to all participants. Their
purpose is to ensure fair treatment for all excursion attendees and those in the queue,
as well as to provide guidelines for organizing excursions.

### 2 § Eligibility for Guild Excursions

All members of the guild are eligible to participate in guild-organised excursions, except
for individuals who are subject to an excursion ban. The guild board or the excursion
organiser may also grant or deny participation in a guild excursion on a case-by-case
basis.

### 3 § Guild Excursions

An excursion is a study trip to an interesting destination. A guild excursion is any visit or
trip in which the guild is involved in organizing.

### 4 § Excursion Registration

Announcing the excursion date, quotas, and registration opening time at least seven (7)
days before registration opens must be striven for. Registration for an excursion is done
by writing one’s name on the registration list, which is kept in the guild room or in
another pre-announced manner. If the primary registration list becomes full, the
excursion organiser must create a waiting list of at least the same size as the quota. The
registration list must include the contact details of the excursion organiser and the
deadline for registration. Participants must provide all required information before the
registration deadline. The excursion organiser has the right to reject incomplete or
incorrect registrations.

### 5 § Excursion Quotas

The excursion organiser or the guild board, in collaboration with the excursion
destination, determines the quotas for each excursion separately. Those responsible for
organizing the excursion have the right to participate without queuing.

### 6 § Queueing for Excursions

Queueing for guild excursions primarily takes place in the guild room or, if the guild
room is closed, at the nearest external entrance. The excursion organiser may also
decide to arrange the queue in another location accessible to guild members. If an
individual decides to start queueing for an excursion, they must announce at the
queueing location that the queue has begun. The person who initiates the queue or the
first person on the queue list is responsible for maintaining the queue in accordance
with the excursion quotas.

Queue presence is monitored through roll calls, which may be conducted by any person
in the queue but no sooner than 15 minutes after the previous roll call. If an individual
fails to be present for two consecutive roll calls, they are removed from the queue. If
someone is unable to queue in person, they may appoint a substitute queuer who does
not queue for their own place. Each person in the queue may only queue for one place
at a time.

### 7 § Excursion Funding

The purpose of excursions is not to generate significant profit. For paid excursions, the
registration list may specify a minimum number of participants, after which the
excursion price cannot be increased. If the minimum number of participants is not met,
the guild has the right to charge an additional fee from those attending the excursion.

### 8 § Cancellation of Registration

A participant may cancel their excursion registration before the registration deadline.
After the deadline, cancellation is only possible by agreement with the excursion
organiser.

### 9 § Absence from an Excursion

If a person with an accepted registration fails to attend an excursion without canceling
their registration before the deadline, the guild board may require them to pay the
excursion fee or part of it.

### 10 § Conduct During Excursions

Each excursion participant is responsible for their own behavior. Participants must
remember that they represent both the guild and the broader student community. Any
individual who causes excessive disturbance or harm may be banned from excursions
by the guild board. In cases of minor misconduct, the guild board may issue an
excursion warning. Participants are personally responsible for any damages they cause
during the excursion. The excursion organiser or the guild board may set additional
specific rules for individual excursions, which must be communicated before the
excursion begins.

The disruptive use of mobile phones is prohibited during guild excursions. Disruptive
use includes, but is not limited to, ringing phones, speaking on the phone, or handling
the phone in any way during a presentation by the excursion host. The excursion
organiser may further specify what constitutes disruptive phone use. If a participant
continues to use their phone disruptively despite warnings, they may be issued an
excursion warning.

### 11 § Excursion Sanctions

The excursion sanctions are excursion bans and excursion warnings, which are
determined by the guild board. Before issuing a sanction, the involved individuals must
be given an opportunity to be heard. All sanctions must be communicated in writing
without delay to the sanctioned individual. The decision may be appealed to the guild
board.

The guild board may impose an excursion ban, which is valid for a fixed period, up to a
maximum of one year. The ban takes effect immediately on the next excursion.

The guild board may issue an excursion warning, which is valid for a fixed period, up to
a maximum of one year. The warning takes effect immediately on the next excursion. If
an individual who has received an excursion warning is issued a second warning during
the validity period, they shall be considered to have received an excursion ban.

### 12 § Matters Not Defined in These Guidelines

Any matters not defined in these guidelines shall be decided by the guild board.
