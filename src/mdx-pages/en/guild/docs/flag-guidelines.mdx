### 1 § The Flag

The official flag of the Guild has a violet background, with the guild’s emblem displayed
in the center in silver and with the text “Automaatio- ja systeemitekniikan kilta -
Aalto-yliopisto” [The Guild of Automation and Systems Technology - Aalto University]
around it. The founding year of the guild, 1998, is placed in the outer bottom corner of
the flag in silver.

The proportions of the flag are approximately 3/2 (width to height), and the diameter of
the emblem and the surrounding text is approximately 3/4 of the flag’s height.

The guild meeting may also approve a representative flag, which can be used when
representing the guild at various events. The representative flag must be clearly
distinguishable from the official flag.

### 2 § Use of the Flag

The guild’s flag is used at official guild ceremonies. Additionally, it may be used at other
dignified events appropriate to its status, in which case the decision regarding its use is
made by the guild board. The flag shall be used in accordance with these flag guidelines.

### 3 § Carrying the Flag

The flag must always be carried on its designated pole. When the flag is carried without
a protective covering, it must be accompanied by a herald of two (2) guild members. The
flag bearer and the flag herald must always wear a student cap. Additionally, the herald
wears the guild’s herald sashes.

### 4 § Honors and Salutes

The flag shall pay tribute to the head of state, the national flag of Finland, the national
anthem, the deceased, and the Polyteknikkojen marssi [Polytechnic March]. This is
performed by lowering the flag slowly to a 45-degree angle and raising it immediately
after the salute.

### 5 § Flag Bearer and Flag Herald

The flag bearer and the flag herald, along with their substitutes, must be members of
the guild, and they are appointed by the guild board. Whenever possible, the flag bearer
and the flag herald must wear a student cap and be appropriately dressed.
