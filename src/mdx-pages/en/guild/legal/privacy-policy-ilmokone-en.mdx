Requests must be made in writing to the Guild. The request must be personally signed. 
Alternatively, individuals can visit the Guild’s room in person to submit their request to a 
member of the Board. In such cases, individuals must prove their identity. The controller will 
respond to the request within the time period specified in the GDPR (generally within one month).
