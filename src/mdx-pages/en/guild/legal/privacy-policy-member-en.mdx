## 4. Purpose of the Register

The legal basis for processing personal data under the EU General Data Protection Regulation is 
a statutory obligation.

The purpose of processing personal data is to maintain a membership register as required by 
Section 11 of the Finnish Associations Act (503/1989) and to manage the contact information of 
the association’s members.

## 5. Information Contained in the Register

- Full name
- Place of residence
- Email address
- Membership type (ordinary member / former member / external member)
- AYY membership (yes / no)
- Consent or lack thereof for sharing membership data with the Guild’s alumni activities after graduation
- Reason for joining the Guild
- Membership status (active / about to become active / passive / terminated)

Data is retained for 365 days after membership expires, after which it is automatically 
deleted from the register.

## 6. Sources of Data in the Register

Data stored in the register is collected from the member themselves upon joining the Guild and 
paying the membership fee.

## 7. Disclosure of Data

Data may be used for Guild activities as determined by the Guild’s Board.
According to Section 11, subsection 2 of the Finnish Associations Act, all Guild members have 
the right to access information about all members’ names, places of residence, and membership 
types.

As a general rule, the controller does not disclose data to third parties or transfer it outside 
the EU or EEA.

The only exceptions to data transfer outside the EU are the data processors Google Workspace and 
Treanglo Oy (Kide.app). Data may be processed by Google and Treanglo Oy in countries outside the 
EU and EEA. In these cases, appropriate data protection measures are ensured, such as the use of 
the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses and other similar arrangements.

## 8. Principles of Data Security

The membership register and its backups are maintained electronically by the Guild’s Treasurer 
in a secure manner. Only the Guild’s Board has access to the register’s data.

## 9. Transfer of Data Outside the EU or EEA

Data may be transferred outside the EU or EEA if the service provider complies with Articles 
44–50 of the GDPR.

## 10. Right to Inspect and Correct Data

Every individual in the register has the right to inspect the data stored about them in the 
Guild’s membership register and request corrections to any inaccuracies.

Requests must be made in writing to the Guild. The request must be personally signed. 
Alternatively, individuals can visit the Guild’s room in person to submit their request to a 
member of the Board. In such cases, individuals must prove their identity. The controller will 
respond to the individual within the time period specified in the EU Data Protection Regulation.

## 11. Data Retention Period

The register only contains data about the Guild’s members. When membership ends, the data is 
deleted after 365 days. In exceptional cases, data may be retained for longer. Members will be 
informed individually about any such exceptions and their reasons.
