# New AS Web

## Technologies

* Gatsby 3 & React 17
* react-bootstrap 1.5.1
* Bootstrap 4.6

and various other plugins, packages etc. as dependencies

## How to run (development build)

Make sure that you have Git, Node.js >= 12.13.0 & npm installed.

Install gatsby-cli globally (you may need root privileges), if you haven't already.

```
npm i -g gatsby-cli
```

Clone this repository and change into the directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/jyrge/ASweb.git

cd ASweb
```

Install dependencies with

```
npm i
```

Run development build and start temporary Web server by running

```
gatsby develop
```

The website is now accessible at http://localhost:8000. You can edit the code with your favourite text editor 
(please don't use Notepad...); the development server watches file changes and rebuilds the site automatically.

And finally, nauti spagetista!
